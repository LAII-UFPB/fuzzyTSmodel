# FuzzyTSmodel

Fuzzy model with automatic rules generation for time series forecasting.

This package is an interface to the [simpful library](https://github.com/aresio/simpful/blob/master/docs/index.rst) intended to be used in a time series forecasting context.
See `sin_exemple.py` to learn how to use it.


We recommend to use uv to install all necessary dependences:
## Installation
```bash
uv pip install -e .
uv sync
```

but if you prefer, you can use pip.
```bash
pip install -e .
pip install -r requeriments.txt
```
